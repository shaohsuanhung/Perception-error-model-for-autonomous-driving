## Progress
Planning + Environment setup + Learn background knowledge and software tool.
### Software Environment setting
- Install dual boot operating system (Ubuntu 20.04 + Windows10)
- Apollo 8.0 download and docker setup
- Go through nuScences dataset tutorial
### Literature Review
- Papers published by Dauwels Lab.

    |On the Simulation of Perception Errors in Autonomous Vehicles|[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11919)|
- Breifly skim over papers about sensor modeling and HMM. [Statistical Sensor Modelling for Autonomous Driving Using Autoregressive Input-Output HMMs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8569592)
### Build up working flow and documents
- Personal notes are recorded on the Notion: [link](https://www.notion.so/Internship-038032cd60894ddeaa32608e5d7dd7ee?pvs=21)
- Share notes including weekly report, code on the Github, link: [github repo](https://github.com/HungFrancis/self-driving-internship-project/tree/main)
- Determine the frequency of progress meeting
    - Bi-Weekly meeting with PhD student.
    - Weekly report on the Github.
    - Frequency of meeting with Dr. Justin still need to be discuessed.
