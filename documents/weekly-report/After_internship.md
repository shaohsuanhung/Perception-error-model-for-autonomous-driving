## Some note to help user to recall how to work on scripts
1. Run the dataset converter under apollo project directory
2. To change the loading of dataset, change the setting in the first few line in the `dataset_converter.py`.
3. To migrate my project on Lab's PC, we should copy/paste the folder `apollo_perception_obstacles` and `HMM_dataset`.
4. To match the file, use the files under matching files.
