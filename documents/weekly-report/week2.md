# Week 2 (July 31 ~ Aug. 4)

**Summary of the week:**  
1. Learning API of Cyber RT and nuScenes dataset. 
2. Converting the nuscenes dataset to .record files.

## Weekly outcome

- Study the cyber_rt protocol and know the whole message passing system to covert the dataset.
- Writing python scripts that convert the nuscenes dataset to .record file.

## Challenging task of the week:

- **How to convert radar data to Apollo**.  
The script that convert the dataset had provided by the Apollo, but they donâ€™t support the radar dataset convertion. So I had to modify the scripts by myself. But first I have to look into several API such as nuscenes dataset Dev-kit API, CyberRT API.

## Next week task

### Urgent
- Convert the nuscenses dataset to .record file
### Regular
- Sent email to Dr.Justin, to discuss scope of the project. Should draft the project proposal and project Gantt chart beforehand.
