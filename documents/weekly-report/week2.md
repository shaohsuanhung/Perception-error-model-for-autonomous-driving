## Week 2 (July 31 ~ Aug. 4)

**Summary of the week:** Learning API of Cyber RT and nuScenes dataset. Converting the nuscenes dataset to .record files.

**Weekly outcome**

- Study the cyber_rt protocol and know the whole message passing system to covert the dataset.
- Try convert the nuscenes dataset to .record file

**Challenging task of the week:**

- How to convert radar data to Apollo [Unsolved]
    - The script that convert the dataset had provided by the Apollo, but they donâ€™t support the radar dataset convertion. So I had to modify the scripts by myself. But first I have to look into several API such as nuscenes dataset Dev-kit API, CyberRT API.

**Next week task**

- **Urgent:**
    - Convert the nuscenses dataset to .record file
- **Regular**
    - Sent email to Dr.Justin, to discuss scope of the project. Should draft the project proposal and project Gantt chart beforehand.
